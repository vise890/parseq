# parseq

A small library of parser combinators that operate on clojure `seq`s

## Intro

A Parser is something that takes a `seq` as input and returns a parsing result:

```
Parser :: [a] -> Result
```

A `Result` can be either a `Success` or a `Failure`:

```
Result :: Success | Failure
```

A `Success` looks like this:

```clojure
[something, [rest-input]]
```

Where `something` is what the was parsed, and the second element in the tuple
is the remaining input.

A `Failure` is a map like this:

```clojure
{:failure msg :any-other-key true}.
```

You can add more info to a `Failure`, like the input that was left, the parser
that was being used at the time, the reason for failure and any other data that
you may have that may be useful to debug.

So to recap:

```
Parser     :: Input -> Result
Result     :: [a, InputLeft] || Failure (+ info maybe)
Combinator :: Parser a -> Parser b
```

## Usage

```clojure
;;; project.clj
[vise890/parseq "0.1.0"]
```

```clojure
(ns parseq.core-test
  (:require [parseq.combinators :as c]
            [parseq.parsers :as p]
            [parseq.utils :as pu]))

(pu/parse sut-p/one-p [1 2])
;; => [1 [2]]

(pu/parse sut-p/one-p [[1 2]])
;; => [[1 2] nil]

(pu/parse (sut-c/peek-c sut-p/one-p) [1 [2 3]])
;; => [1 [1 [2 3]]]

(pu/parse (sut-c/many-c (sut-p/->one=-p 1)) [1 1 1 :a :a :a])
;; => [[1 1 1] [:a :a :a]]

;; there's a bit more, but you'll have to look at the source for now

;; TODO add more examples / docs
```
